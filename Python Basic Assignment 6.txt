1.What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
Ans-> Escape characters represent characters in string values that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to type into code. In Python strings, the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. 
It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return.

2.What do the escape characters n and t stand for?
Ans-> \n is a newline; \t is a tab.

3.What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?
Ans-> The \\ escape character will represent a backslash character.

4.The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?
Ans-> The single quote in Howl's is fine because you’ve used double quotes to mark the beginning and end of the string.

5.How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?
Ans-> Multiline strings allow you to use newlines in strings without the \n escape character.

8. What are the values of the following expressions?
