1.To what does a relative path refer?
Ans->  The path with reference to current directory is called relative.  Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. ... The current directory is sometimes referred to as the root directory. Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd) .

2.What is the first step on an absolute path?
Ans-> An Absolute path of any directory always starts with a slash (/) representing the directory root. Besides this, all slashes in the directory path separate the directories. All directories names in the absolute path are written in the hierarchy order. absolute path is a complete path from start of actual file system from / directory. Relative path. 

3.On Windows, what does Path('C:/Users') / 'Al' evaluate to?
Ans->The C:\ part of the path is the root folder, which contains all other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named C:\ and is also called the C: drive. Users, Al  refer to folders (also called directories) ('C:/Users') is a home directory and  ‘AI’ is subdirectories.

4.On Windows, what does 'C:/Users' / 'Al' evaluate to?
Ans->The C:\ part of the path is the root folder, which contains all other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named C:\ and is also called the C: drive. Users, Al  refer to folders (also called directories)

5.What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?
Ans-> getcwd() : CWD stands for Current Working Directory. This function allows you to see what your current working directory is. chdir("path-to-dir") : Short for CHange DIRectory, this function allows you to set the current working directory to a path of your choice.
getcwd() method tells us the location of current working directory (CWD).
1.	Syntax: os.getcwd()
2.	Parameter: No parameter is required.
3.	Return Value: This method returns a string which represents the current working di-rectory.
 chdir() changes the current working directory to the given path.It returns None in all the cas-es. Syntax :os.chdir(path)

#!/usr/bin/python
import os

path = "/usr/tmp"

# Check current working directory.
retval = os.getcwd()
print "Current working directory %s" % retval

# Now change the directory
os.chdir( path )

# Check current working directory.
retval = os.getcwd()

print "Directory changed successfully %s" % retval
When we run above program, it produces following result −
Current working directory /usr
Directory changed successfully /usr/tmp



6.What is the difference between the. and.. folders?
  Ans-> The single dot is a meta-location, meaning the folder you are currently in. The double dot is an indicator that you can move back from this location. That is, you're in a folder inside of another folder. Single dot "." stands for current directory and double dots ".." mean parent directory. Similarly "~" stands for home directory. These shortcuts come in very handy because you don't have to type in complete path of any file you want to access in a particular (or current) directory. For Example- typing cd ..



7.Which part of C:baconeggsspam.txt is the dir name and which part is the base name?
Ans-> C:\bacon\eggs is the dir name, while spam. txt is the base name.



8.What are the three “mode” arguments that the open() function accepts?
Ans-> There are three kinds of mode, that open function accept:
•	“ r “, for reading.
•	“ w “, for writing.
•	“ a “, for appending.
•	“ r+ “, for both reading and writing.
The access modes available for the open() function are as follows:
•	r : Opens the file in read-only mode. ... 
•	rb : Opens the file as read-only in binary format and starts reading from the beginning of the file. ... 
•	r+ : Opens a file for reading and writing, placing the pointer at the beginning of the fil



9.What happens if you open existing file in write mode?
Ans->To open a file in write mode, “w” is specified. When mode “w” is specified, it creates an empty file for output operations. What if the file already exists? If a file with the same name already exists, its contents are discarded and the file is treated as a new empty file.



10.How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?
Ans->The only difference between the Read() and ReadLines() is that Console. Read is used to read only single character from the standard output device, while Console. ReadLine is used to read a line or string from the standard output device.
read() would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character. The readlines() function, on the other hand, on-ly reads a single  or list of line of the file in string.

If you have a file (test.txt) like so:
first line
second line
third line


Then this code:
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
    line = file.readline()
    print(line)
Will produce this output:
first line
That's because readline just reads the next line.
If you use this code instead:
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Output:
first line
second line
third line
read() reads the entire contents of the file into a string. You can also give read() an optional argument, which designates the number of characters to read from the file:
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read(15)
    print(content)
Output:
first line
seco
readlines(), which returns a list of lines (strings):
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)
Output:
['first line\n', 'second line\n', 'third line\n']



11.How does a shelf value resemble a data structure?
Ans->  A shelf value resembles a dictionary value; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same names.
Data structures are a way to organize information in a computer's memory. It  fa-cilitate storage and retrieval of  information In  Arrays and lists ,Objects, hash maps and dictionaries indexing is used so, shelf value resemble a data structure.
