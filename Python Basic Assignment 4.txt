1. What exactly is []?
Ans: This is use for list in python like a=[],Where 'a' is a List.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans: spam[2]='hello'


Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a','b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.]
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans: Answer of this expression is d

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans: d is the value of this expression.

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans: ['a','b'] is the value of this expression.

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans: 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans:  List concatenation : This is done we have many separate and different list and we want to processed in a similar manner.
          List replication : This is done when we have one list and we want that values for multiple times in same list.

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans: append insert that value into list at the end append is single argument function.
         insert is the 2 argument function which require the value to be insert and the index number at where we want to insert that value.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list? 
Ans: list.remove('value'),  list.pop('index number of value')

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans: We can create list any type of data type same as we can create a string with any value. for string= "test1.0,3" this is a complete string
         for list =['test', 1.0, 3] 

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans: List can be edit like insert, remove and modify but tuple is static or we can say fixed we can't edit a tuple.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans:  	a=(10,42,152,25)
	for i in range(len(a)):
    	      if a[i]==42:
       	            print(a[i])

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans: a=(10,42,152,25)
         b=[52,125,58,25]
         print(list(a))
         print(tuple(b))


16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans: They can contain any datatype of value can contain String, Integer, Float, Character, Boolean.


17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans: A copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
         A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
