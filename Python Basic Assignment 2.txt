1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: AND, NOT, OR

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans:	             : AND :
	X	Y	Result
	0	0	0
	1	0	0
	0	1	0
	1	1	1

	              : OR :
	X	Y	Result
	0	0	0
	1	0	1
'	0	1	1
	1	1	1

	              : NOT :
	X	Result
	0	1
	1	0
	 

4. What are the values of the following expressions? 
               a):  (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
               b):  not (5 > 4) 
               c):  (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) 
               d):  not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
               e):  (True andTrue) and (True == False)
               f):   (not False) or (not True)
Ans:  a): False
          b): False
          c): True
          d): False
          e): False
          f): True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans: 1): == 
         2): !=
         3): >
         4): <
         5): >=
         6): <=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans: equal to is == and assignment operators is = 
	if we want to assign any value to variable then = sign 
	if we compare then variable1 == variable2

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
	spam = 0
	if spam == 10:
	    print('eggs')
	if spam > 5:
	    print('bacon')
	else:
	    print('ham')
	    print('spam')
	    print('spam')
Ans: First if contion is to check that spam is equal to 10 
         Second if condtion is to check that spam is greater than 5 
         Last else is that, upper both conditions are not satisfied then else condition execute


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans: spam=0
         if(spam==1):
             print('Hello')
         if(spam==2):
             print('Howdy')
         eles:
             print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans: Ctrl+c (Keyboard intrupt)

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans: Break statement resumes the control of the program to the end of loop and made executional flow outside that loop.
         Continue statement resumes the control of the program to the next iteration of that loop enclosing 'continue' and made executional flow inside the loop again.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: All for loop results are same in first range(10) its default starting position is  0 and end postion is 9 and in range(0,10) its starting position is 0 because we         define its starting position and end at 9 and in range(0,10,1) its starting position is 0 because we define its starting position and end at 9 and we assign         increment by 1.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans: for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)
   
         i=1
         while(i<=10):
	print(i)
	i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: import spam 
         spam.bacon()
